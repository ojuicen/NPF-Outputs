## [Reconnecting Communities Award Speech by Pete Buttigieg](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/transcript-us-transportation-secretary-pete-buttigieg-remarks-reconnecting)

### Micro
- **Moral Binary Framing: Pairs a vivid “bad” and “good”**  
  A road can either divide a neighborhood, while blasting vehicle traffic through the heart of a city without regard to those who live and work there. Or that same road with a better design could tie that neighborhood together.
- **Identity & Personal Appeal**  
  Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who is— I think you already know this, but she lives and breathes her Alabama communities, and she never lets us forget what they need.

### Meso
- **Coalition & Local-Federal Alignment**  
  Which means that every penny of this project and every penny of the billions coming to Alabama for infrastructure is there because she and others partnered with President Biden to get this infrastructure package done.
- **Policy Subsystem Reframing**  
  That’s why President Biden made sure to weave equity into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, creating a first-of-its-kind, Reconnecting Communities program to build infrastructure that unites where federally funded infrastructure once served to divide.
- **Community-Driven Framing**  
  These are locally-led, community-driven visions. The Biden-Harris administration came to office, understanding that the good ideas weren’t all going to come from Washington, but that more of the funding should, and now, at last, it is.

### Macro
- **Civil-Rights Legacy & Historical Continuity**  
  We are on hallowed ground. Sixty years since the Civil Rights Act, the courage that people showed on these streets changed America’s history for the better, helped make our democracy more democratic.
- **Ripple effect**  
  And we know that the example from here can radiate out, as Reverend Shuttlesworth said, “As Birmingham goes, so goes the nation.”
- **Historical Redemption Narrative**  
  First, because it is important to understand how conditions of the present are related to the choices of the past, but also because facing our past as Birmingham has taught us again and again is the first step toward making better choices about the future. This is not an exercise in blame or guilt; it is an opportunity to mend, to repair, and to make current and future generations better off, which is exactly what you are doing here, and exactly why we are so proud to support it.

## [Healthcare Speech by Obama to Joint Congress](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-a-joint-session-congress-health-care)

### Micro
- **Empathetic Storytelling**  
  One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it.
- **Personal Moral Positioning**  
  I am not the first President to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.

### Meso
- **Policy Subsystem Reframing**  
  Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.
- **Coalition Building Across Party Lines**  
  And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead. If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be there to listen. My door is always open.
- **Stakeholder Alliance Construction**  
  Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups, and even drug companies—many of whom opposed reform in the past.

### Macro
- **Progressive Era Legacy/New Deal Myth**  
  In 1935, when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism, but the men and women of Congress stood fast, and we are all the better for it.
- **Frontier Spirit of Collective Challenge**  
  We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it’s hard. (Applause.) I still believe—I still believe that we can act when it's hard.
- **American Character Invocation**  
  That large-heartedness—that concern and regard for the plight of others—is not a partisan feeling. It’s not a Republican or a Democratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character—our ability to stand in other people’s shoes.
- **Inverted Exceptionalism/Moral Failure**  
  We are the only democracy—the only advanced democracy on Earth—the only wealthy nation—that allows such hardship for millions of its people. There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage.
- **Redemptive Arc Framing**  
  You see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem. They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom. But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, the vulnerable can be exploited.

## (Obama's Climate Change Remarks)[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/remarks-president-climate-change}

### Micro
- **Empathetic Future-Generation Appeal**  
  And someday, our children, and our children’s children, will look at us in the eye and they'll ask us, did we do all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem and leave them a cleaner, safer, more stable world? And I want to be able to say, yes, we did. Don’t you want that?
- **Personal Moral Positioning as Father & President**  
  As a President, as a father, and as an American, I’m here to say we need to act.
- **Scientific Authority Appeal**  
  Ninety-seven percent of scientists, including, by the way, some who originally disputed the data, have now put that to rest. They've acknowledged the planet is warming and human activity is contributing to it.
- **Mockery/Ridicule of Opposition**  
  We don’t have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society. (Applause.) Sticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it’s not going to protect you from the coming storm.

### Meso
- **Economic Reframing of Environmental Policy**  
  Today, we use more clean energy—more renewables and natural gas—which is supporting hundreds of thousands of good jobs. We waste less energy, which saves you money at the pump and in your pocketbooks. And guess what—our economy is 60 percent bigger than it was 20 years ago, while our carbon emissions are roughly back to where they were 20 years ago.
- **Historical Opposition Pattern**  
  And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children’s health. And every time, they've been wrong.
- **Coalition Building Through Bipartisan History**  
  Richard Nixon opened the EPA. George H.W. Bush declared—first U.S. President to declare—“human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and unprecedented ways.” Someone who never shies away from a challenge, John McCain, introduced a market-based cap-and-trade bill to slow carbon pollution.

### Macro
- **Space Program/Frontier Heritage**  
  On Christmas Eve, 1968, the astronauts of Apollo 8 did a live broadcast from lunar orbit. So Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, William Anders—the first humans to orbit the moon—described what they saw, and they read Scripture from the Book of Genesis to the rest of us. And later that night, they took a photo that would change the way we see and think about our world. It was an image of Earth—beautiful; breathtaking; a glowing marble of blue oceans, green forests, and brown mountains brushed with white clouds, rising over the surface of the moon.
- **American Innovation Myth**  
  The old rules may say we can’t protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we’ve always used new technologies—we’ve used science; we’ve used research and development and discovery to make the old rules obsolete.
- **Global Leadership Destiny**  
  And make no mistake—the world still looks to America to lead. When I spoke to young people in Turkey a few years ago, the first question I got wasn't about the challenges that part of the world faces. It was about the climate challenge that we all face, and America's role in addressing it... 
- **Generational Stewardship Legacy**  
  Our founders believed that those of us in positions of power are elected not just to serve as custodians of the present, but as caretakers of the future. And they charged us to make decisions with an eye on a longer horizon than the arc of our own political careers.

## (Reagan's Farewell Address to the Nation)[https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/farewell-address-nation]

### Micro
- **Personal Legacy Positioning**  
  My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.
- **Fatherly Warning/Advice**  
  And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let 'em know and nail 'em on it. That would be a very American thing to do.
- **Intimate Connection Appeal**  
  And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass, and connect. Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.

### Meso
- **Policy Vindication Through Results**  
  Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong. The fact is, what they called “radical” was really “right.” What they called “dangerous” was just “desperately needed.”
- **Coalition Handoff Strategy**  
  If we're to finish the job, Reagan's regiments will have to become the Bush brigades. Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.

### Macro
- **City Upon a Hill Mythology**  
  I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity.
- **American Exceptionalism & Global Transformation**  
  We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world. Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past.
- **Founding Principles Restoration**  
  Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with three little words: “We the People.” “We the People” tell the government what to do; it doesn't tell us.

## [Infrastructure 0.9 Speech-Style](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/ai_speech_style_comparision.md#infrastructure-09-speech-style)

### Micro
- **Heroes vs. Villains Binary**  
  In this narrative, we find the heroes among us—engineers, construction workers, policy advocates, and local leaders—who tirelessly champion the cause of rebuilding and renewing our infrastructure. Their vision is clear: a resilient, interconnected framework that can sustain our economy, enhance our national security, and improve the quality of life for every citizen. Opposing this noble endeavor, however, are the forces of resistance—those who argue against investment, citing costs without accounting for the far greater price of inaction.
- **Victim Identification & Empathy**  
  Caught in this conflict are the everyday Americans: the commuters who endure hours in traffic on crumbling highways, the families who suffer from power outages during storms, and the communities that remain isolated due to inadequate transportation networks.

### Meso
- **Economic Reframing Strategy**  
  These initiatives are not mere expenditures but investments in our collective future, ensuring sustainability for generations to come.
- **Policy Path Choice**  
  We face a choice between two paths: one leads to continued decay, while the other paves the way toward revitalization and prosperity.

### Macro
- **American Dream Renewal**  
  Instead, let us be the architects of a renewed American dream, forged in steel and stone, but more importantly, in the unwavering conviction that our best days lie ahead.

## [Healthcare Reform 0.9 Speech-style](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/ai_speech_style_comparision.md#healthcare-reform-09-speech-style)

### Micro
- **Victim Empathy & Personal Stakes**  
  They are the parents who forego their own health care to afford treatment for their children, the seniors who must choose between prescriptions and groceries, and the young professionals who forgo entrepreneurial dreams for fear of losing employer-provided insurance.

### Meso
- **Rights-Based Policy Reframing**  
  Picture a landscape where healthcare is not a privilege for the few, but a fundamental right for all.
- **Policy as Moral Imperative**  
  Our proposed policy for healthcare reform is not merely a piece of legislation but a roadmap to justice and equity.

### Macro
- **Societal Moral Measurement**  
  We must remember that the measure of a society is not in the wealth of its strongest but in the welfare of its weakest.

## [Immigration Reform 0.9 Speech-style](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/ai_speech_style_comparision.md#immigration-reform-09-speech-style)

### Micro
- **Personal Hero Character Creation**  
  Among the advocates for a brighter tomorrow stands Maria Hernandez, an extraordinary woman who embodies the essence of resilience and determination. Maria, the daughter of immigrants, has dedicated her life to enriching her community through education and service.
- **Victim Empathy Appeal**  
  Meanwhile, the victims—hardworking families and aspiring citizens—wait in the shadows, trapped in uncertainty, their dreams deferred.

### Macro
- **Nation of Immigrants Mythology**  
  We must champion a comprehensive reform that reflects our values and honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants.
- **American Progress Narrative**  
  In closing, let us remember that the story of America is one of relentless progress and unwavering compassion. It is a narrative that beckons us to act with courage and conviction, to write the next chapter with ink that reflects our highest ideals.

## [Climate Change 0.9 Speech-style](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/ai_speech_style_comparision.md#climate-change-09-speech-style)

### Micro
- **Victim Empathy Appeal**  
  Caught in this conflict are the victims: the farmers who watch as droughts wither their crops, the urban poor who suffer disproportionately from escalating heatwaves and pollution, and the wildlife whose habitats vanish, pushing them toward extinction.

### Macro
- **Intergenerational Stewardship Legacy**  
  Let us commit to this moral imperative: stewardship of the earth is not optional but essential. We must bequeath to our descendants a planet that thrives rather than withers.
- **Historical Judgement Legacy**  
  Let history remember us as the generation that stood united against apathy and fear, choosing courage and wisdom to light the path forward.

  They champion the vision of a strategic partnership, uniting the brightest minds and most innovative companies from Israel and the United States in a collaborative endeavor to shape the future of artificial intelligence.

## [AI Pete Buttigieg on Infrastructure](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/emulation_gpt_outputs.md#pete-buttigieg-on-infrastructure)

### Micro
- **Vision-Based Motivation**  
  Imagine cities where public transportation is not only fast and efficient but clean and carbon-neutral. Imagine rural communities connected to the world through cutting-edge broadband networks.

### Meso
- **Public-Private Partnership Strategy**  
  Through partnerships with the private sector, we can accelerate the deployment of high-speed rail and explore next-generation transportation like hyperloops and autonomous vehicles.
- **Multi-Level Coalition Building**  
  Today, I call on Congress, state and local leaders, businesses, and citizens to join us in this journey.

### Macro
- **Pioneer Identity Appeal**  
  Like the pioneers of the past who charted unknown territories, we too are pioneers in our time. We are tasked with the responsibility—and the privilege—to reimagine the future of our infrastructure.
- **Historical Parallel/Continuity**  
  Just as the interstate highway system revolutionized our nation in the 20th century, so too can these innovations redefine the possibilities of the 21st.
- **New Frontier Mythology**  
  Today, I stand before you to talk about an opportunity—an opportunity to embark on a grand adventure across what I like to call America’s “New Frontier.” This frontier is not defined by new lands or untapped resources, but by the urgent need to renew and transform our infrastructure.

## [AI Barack Obama on Healthcare](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/emulation_gpt_outputs.md#barack-obama-on-healthcare)

### Micro
- **Personal Moral Positioning & Call to Action**  
  Scripture tells us, “Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only.” And so, we must act.
- **Vision-Based Empathy Appeal**  
  Imagine a nation where every child, adult, and senior can access mental health services without fear of judgment or financial ruin. Imagine the potential that could be unleashed if we lift the burden that mental illness places on millions of families.

### Meso
- **Multi-Stakeholder Coalition Building**  
  We all play a part in this journey. Government, yes, must lead the way in expanding access and funding. But businesses, communities, schools, and churches must also step up—providing spaces of support and understanding where people can find refuge and relief.
- **Legislative Strategy & Process**  
  In the coming weeks and months, I’ll be reaching out across the aisle, visiting communities, and meeting with healthcare providers and stakeholders. We’ll host summits and discussions to ensure that every voice is heard. Together, we will craft a system that works for all of us, not just for some.

### Macro
- **Promised Land Mythology**  
  Tonight, I want to talk to you about a journey we must take together—a journey towards a Promised Land where every American has access to universal mental-health coverage.
- **Civil Rights Legacy Continuation**  
  I believe firmly in our capacity to adapt and grow. The journey might be long, with obstacles along the way, but as Dr. King reminded us, faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase. We may not see every step laid out before us, but we must take that first step together.
- **American Historical Triumph Pattern**  
  Overcoming great challenges is what we do as Americans. In the 20th century, we built a healthcare system that sent polio packing and ushered in an era of medical miracles. We tackled issues of civil rights, giving voice and hope to the oppressed.

### Micro
- **Direct Youth Appeal**  
  I want to speak directly to the young people watching tonight. I know that many of you look at the world and feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenges ahead. But know this: you are not alone, and your efforts matter.
- **Personal Testimony & Witness**  
  I’ve had the privilege of seeing firsthand the ingenuity and determination that exists across this nation. From the solar farms in the deserts of Arizona to the wind turbine projects off the coasts of Maine, I’ve been inspired by the entrepreneurs and workers forging a new future.

### Meso
- **Just Transition Coalition Building**  
  For the coal miner in West Virginia, the factory worker in Ohio, or the oil rig operator in Texas, there must be pathways to new opportunities and new careers. We owe it to each other to build a society that supports every American, ensuring that the changing tides of industry bring prosperity, not hardship.
- **Multi-Sector Participation Strategy**  
  Local communities, businesses—big and small—and every one of us must contribute to this common goal. This is not just the work of policymakers in Washington.

### Macro
- **Energy Frontier Mythology**  
  I’m talking about the energy frontier we face today, a frontier that demands the spirit of pioneers, trailblazers, and visionaries. Our journey toward a net-zero America by 2050 represents one of our nation’s most profound challenges and one of our greatest opportunities. It is the final “Energy Frontier.”
- **American Achievement Legacy**  
  ...and it calls upon us to summon the same resolve that settled the West, landed a man on the moon, and laid down the tracks of our fabled railways. Our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is not just a lofty ambition or mere policy objective; it is a commitment to our planet, our children, and the collective future of humanity. It’s about building a legacy that respects the delicate balance of our ecosystems and honors the beauty of our natural world—a world that has given us so much.
- **Kennedy Space Program Echo**  
  We do this not because it is easy, as one President once said, but because it is hard—because the hard things are worth doing. They define who we are and what we can become.

## [AI Ronald Reagan on Immigration](https://github.com/ojuicen/NPF-Outputs/blob/main/results/emulation_gpt_outputs.md#ronald-reagan-on-immigration)

### Meso
- **Bipartisan Coalition Appeal**  
  We must work together, across party lines, not as adversaries but as fellow travelers on this shared journey. We must seek common ground, understanding that our strength lies not in our divisions, but in our unity—our ability to reach consensus for the greater good of our nation.
- **Balanced Policy Framework**  
  It must secure our borders, ensuring the safety and sovereignty that every nation has the right to maintain. At the same time, it must provide a pathway to citizenship for those who contribute to our society.

### Macro
- **Manifest Destiny Continuation**  
  It carries within it the echoes of Manifest Destiny, not as a closed chapter, but as a continuing saga in the great American story. Our ancestors, from every corner of the world, embarked on voyages not merely across oceans but toward the dream of a land where liberty and opportunity know no bounds. They were guided by the North Star of freedom, seeking a place where their children and their children's children could live in peace and prosperity. This journey was not just about the expansion of land; it was about the expansion of the American promise.
- **Nation of Immigrants Foundation**  
  We must remember that immigration is the lifeblood of innovation and cultural richness. It is the engine that drives our economic vitality and the wellspring of our nation's diversity. It is the very essence of who we are: a nation built by immigrants, fueled by dreams, and guided by the principles of justice and equality.
- **National Vision Legacy**  
  As I prepare to say farewell, I leave you with a vision—where every child born into this great land knows the promise of America, where every aspiring immigrant sees our country as a land of opportunity, and where our actions reflect the belief that we are constantly moving toward that more perfect union.
