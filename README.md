## Baseline NPF Analysis

Per our paper, for each speech we perform a basic NPF Analysis identifying the following:

- **Setting:** The setting depicted in the speech.  
- **Characters:** Hero, villain, and victim.  
- **Plot:** The type of literary plot.
- **Moral:** Any suggested moral action.

## Three-Level Narrative Comparison

Per our paper, for each topic we pair:

- **1 human** speech  
- **1 existing AI** speech (temp 0.9 Speech-style)  
- **1 new AI-emulation** speech (modern context prompts)

And analyze via:

1. **Micro-level**: The individual level and how individuals both inform and are informed by narratives.
2. **Meso-level**: Coalition or partisan alignment; interacting narratives.
3. **Macro-level**: How policy narratives embedded in cultures and institutions shape public policy: national myths & cultural motifs (“New Frontier,” “Manifest Destiny,” etc).

We then compare narrative structures, literary strategies, and reuse of historical policy tropes.
