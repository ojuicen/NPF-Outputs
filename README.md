## Baseline NPF Analysis

Per our paper, for each speech we perform a basic NPF Analysis identifying the following:

- **Setting:** The setting depicted in the speech.  
- **Characters:** Hero, villain, and victim.  
- **Plot:** The type of literary plot.
- **Moral:** Any suggested moral action.

## Three-Level Narrative Comparison

Per our paper, for each topic we pair:

- **1 human** speech  
- **1 existing AI** speech (temp 0.9 Speech-style)  
- **1 AI-emulation** speech (modern context prompts)

And analyze via:

1. **Micro-level**: How the speech appeals to individuals’ beliefs and emotions—e.g. moral binaries, personal duties, etc.
2. **Meso-level**: How coalitions and interest groups deploy competing narratives.
3. **Macro-level**: How the speech taps national‐level cultural frames—Civil Rights movements, freedom movements, etc.

We then compare narrative structures, literary strategies, and reuse of historical policy tropes.
